# My Personal Website

[JKomskis.com](https://jkomskis.com), now backed by Azure Storage, Azure CDN, and Cloudflare.

## Setup

1. Install [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-8.0.0) and [Azure Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-8.0.0).
2. Run `npm ci` to setup dependencies

## Usage

* Run `npm run build` to build the website (files are placed in _site/)
* Run `npm run build:prod` to create a production build of the website (files are placed in _site/)
* Run `npm run serve` to host the _site/ folder locally

## Deploying

When deploying the project, the following secrets are needed in a Github environment named `deploy`:

* `ARM_CLIENT_ID` - Azure service principal client ID; needed for Terraform
* `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET` - Azure service principal client secret; needed for Terraform
* `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` - Azure service principal subscription ID; needed for Terraform
* `ARM_TENANT_ID` - Azure service principal tenant ID; needed for Terraform
* `AZURE CREDENTIALS` - JSON object returned when an Azure service principal is created; needed for the az login action
* `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - Cloudflare API token; needed for terraform
* `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL` - Cloudflare account email; needed for terraform

The Azure service principal should have contributor rights over the subscription when the resources will be deployed.
The Cloudflare API token should have DNS edit permissions over the appropriate domain.

## Environmental Variables

The following environmental variables are used:

* `API_BASE_PATH` - Used when building the website. Specifies the base path for languagegarbler API requests.
* `OBSCENE_COMMITS_ACCOUNT_NAME` - Used when building the website. Specifies the account name where the ObsceneCommits archives are stored.
* `ARCHIVE_CONTAINER_NAME` - Used when building the website. Specifies the container name where the ObsceneCommits archives are stored.
* `FRONTEND_PATH_PREFIX` (Optional) - Used when building the website. Specifies the path under which the website will be built.
